APU3/4 | TPM1a
-----|-----
1 (**LFRAME**) | 11
2 (**LAD3**) | 9
3 (**LAD2**) | 7
4 (**LAD1**) | 5
5 (**LAD0**) | 3
6 (**GND**) | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 17
7 (**LPCRST**) | 13
8 (**LPCCLK1**) | 1
9 (**V3**) | 18

## TPM1a

* At least one pin of no. **2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 17** should be connected 
to **GND** and pin no. **18** should be connected to **V3**.
* Pins no. **14, 15, 16, 19 and 20** stay unconnected.


## APU3/4

* Pin no. **6** should be connected to **GND** and pin no. **9** should be 
connected to **V3**.

### Important!

It should be noticed, that the LPC debug holes on apu board are much smaller,
so regular pin header will not fit there.
